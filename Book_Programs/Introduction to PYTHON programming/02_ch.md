### How Python sees variables ?
    Variables in Python do not have fixed locations unlike other programming languages. The location they refer to changes every time their value change.
    For example:
        1. x=10
        2. y=x
        3. x=12
    In line 2, x and y points to the same memory locations. Then line 3, x now points to new memory location.
